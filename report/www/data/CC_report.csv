Thus, most of the variation in yields was due to the differences in environmental conditions experienced each year. The small contributions of the variance components of year x rotation (0 Mg2 / ha2) and year x N rate (0.01 Mg2 / ha2) interactions suggest that the weather conditions affected treatments equally and were the major determinant of grain yield."

""Subsequent corn grain yields were significantly higher in 2 of 3 years where cover crops were grown and were simliar following winter-filled oat, winter triticale, and winter rye with and without the top growth removed. The lack of significant grain yield differences between the rye cover crop with and without the top growth removed suggests that any benefical cover crop effect is mainly associated with the presence of a cover crop in the crop sequence rather than the top growth. In addition to the general benefit of providing wind erosion control on sandy soils, results from this study show that fall-planted cover crops such as oat, winter triticale, and winter rye can provide significant yield benefits to the subsequent corn crop at slightly lower nitrogen fertilizer rates (20 kg / ha) in some years."""

In the first year of the study (1982), when hairy vetch top growth was retarded with herbicies soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations increased at 0-3 in. depths compared to winter fallow, whereas there was no effect of hairy vetch that was unterminated or fully terminated with herbicides compared to winter fallow at both soil depths measured. In the second year of the study, there was no effect of hairy vetch compared to winter fallow at all soil depths and for all cover crop termination strategies. In the third year, at shallow depths unterminated hairy vetch decreased soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations and had no effect deeper in the soil profile. However, when hairy vetch top growth was terminated with herbicides soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations  increased at shallow depths, but no effect was observed 3-6 in in the soil profile.
