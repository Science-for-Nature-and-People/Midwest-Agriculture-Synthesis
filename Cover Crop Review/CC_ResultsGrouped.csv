However, the control contributed by the cover crop could presumably improve control where the population density of the weeds was high, or where environmental conditions reduce herbicide effectiveness. Where control from the cover crops helps to reduce the population density within the first month or so following soybean planting, there would presumably be reduced selection for resistance to the herbicides used in POST treatments.","468","Pigweed","Weeds"

The exceptions were crickets (decreased abundance with cover crops) and beetles (increased abundance with cover crops).","The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of a rye cover crop planted within annually rotated corn and soybean on both the beneficial ground and canopy-dwelling communities. Community composition and most individual taxa did not respond significantly to the addition of the rye cover crop. Community compositions were more often affected by sampling data, as capture of nearly all individual taxa significantly varied by sampling date. Of those taxa that did respond to the addition of the rye cover crop, Carabidae [ground beetles] were more frequently captured during June and July sampling dates while Gryllidae [crickets] were least frequently captured during June sampling. The enemies hypothesis predicts that natural enemies wuch as predators and parasitoids would be more abundant in agroecosystems with greater plant diversity compared with monocultures (Root 1973, Andow 1991). However, Carabidae [Coleoptera] captured from soybean plots were the only individual taxa in the entire study to have significantly greater activity density when rye was included within the rotation.
