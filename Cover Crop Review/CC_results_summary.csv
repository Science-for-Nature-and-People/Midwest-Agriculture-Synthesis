"1",1,"They found maize and soybean seedling densities were unaffected by cover crops from 2002-2009.  They found cover crops did not affect maize or soybean yields.  They found cover crops did not alter soil organic carbon levels in no-tillage, moldboard plow, and chisel plow systems compared to the same tillage system without cover crop. ","Average maize and soybean seedling densities were unaffected by both cereal rye and hairy vetch cover crops from 2002 to 2009. ""Based on 8 years of crop yield measurements (4 years corn and 4 years soybean) for three tillage systems with and without cover crops, cover crops did not affect plant populations or crop yields."" For each tillage treatment with cover crops, there was no observable net increase in soil carbon sequestration when compared with the soil organic carbon levels for each tillage treatment without cover crops in 2000."
"2",2,"They found no impact of rye cover crops on maize and soybean yields, but oat cover crops reduced yields four out of six years.

They found rye and oat cover crops reduced nitrate leaching through soils compared to winter fallow. ","The effect of cover crops on maize and soybean yields was dependent on the cover crop. Rye cover crops had no effect on soybean or maize yields from 2005 to 2010 compared to winter fallow. Oat cover crops, alternatively, reduced maize and soybean yields from 2005 to 2008 compared to winter fallow. Cash crop yields were unaffected by oat cover crops in 2009 and 2010. ""In all 5 years a large part of the drainage occurred in spring and early summer. There were no significant differences among treatments for annual cumulative drainage. In general, the large variability in cumulative drainage among replications within treatments made it difficult to detect treatment differences if they existed.""

""Corn yields in 2006 and 2008 were much higher than in 2010, which would have resulted in greater plant demand for nitrogen and likely contributed to the low stalk nitrate values in those years.""

They found similar amounts of water extractable organic carbon following three winters of cover crops (winter rye, cereal rye, and tillage radish) compared to winter fallow. ","A slight decrease (not significant) in denitrification rates was observed with rye cover crop compared to winter fallow. ""Within three years of cover crop implementation, cereal rye, and tillage radish residues have not increased the water extractable organic content in soils relative to the other treatments.

"4",4,"They found no impact of winter cover crops on the amount of ammonium in soil compared to winter fallow.  They found no significant impacts of cover crops on bulk density  They found cash crop yields were unaffected by winter cover crops.  They found no impact of cover crops on pH.

Forage radish and forage radish mixed with buckwheat as cover crops had no effect on plant available phosphorous compared to winter fallow. The only cover crop treatment to reduce plant available phosphorous levels was the three way mixture of forage radish, hairy vetch, and cereal rye. There was no effect of cover crop treatment or field location (headland & non-headland) on soil nitrogen (nitrate & ammonium). ""Cover crop treatment of forage radish, hairy vetch, cereal rye seemed to increase the penetration resistance slightly within the non-headlands areas in comparison with the other treatments likely related to the cover crops still growing and extracting water from the profile at the time of measurement."" Maize and soybean yields were unaffected by winter cover crops compared to winter fallow in both headlands and non-headland field areas. Cover crops did not influence total carbon stocks in the soils in either headlands or non-headlands. There were measurable increases in total carbon within the headlands relative to the non-headlands areas in the spring and up  40 cm in depth, but these gains were not statistically significant (p = 0.1005). Cover crops did not influence water aggregate stability in either headlands or non-headlands (p = 0.5356).

growth and development is strongly temperature dependent.
The rate of SCN egg development increases linearly with
temperature between 15 and 30 C but ceases all together at
temperatures below 10 C (Alston and Schmitt 1988).
Previous studies have shown that henbit and purple deadnettle
can support SCN reproduction at levels comparable to SCNsusceptible
soybean in the greenhouse (Creech et al. 2007a;
Venkatesh et al. 2000). In the field, however, soil temperatures
are not optimal for SCN development at the time that
winter annual weeds are actively growing. Soil temperature
data collected in these plots over the course of the study
suggest that the period of overlap between high SCN activity
and winter annual weed growth is likely limited to a few weeks
in early autumn and late spring (data not shown).
Although the ability of SCN to reproduce on henbit and
purple deadnettle under field conditions in Indiana, Illinois,
and Ohio has also been confirmed (Creech et al. 2005,

reproduction on winter annual weeds appears to contribute
little, if any, to the overall SCN population levels in the field.

At the Lamberton, MN site, alfalfa and red clover managed with imazethapyr reduced egg densities in the first and second year of the study while perennial ryegrass had no affect on egg densities in either year of the study. the Rosemount, MN site, alfalfa and red clover managed with no other herbicide regime reduced egg densities in the first year of the study. In the second year, the density of soybean cyst nematode eggs decreased with red clover cover crops terminated with imazethapyr only. All other cover crops and herbicide regimes had no affect on egg densities. At Waseca, MN, perennial ryegrass resulted in lower soybean yields compared to its control, whereas yields following alfalfa and red clover were similar to their controls. At Lamberton, MN, alfalfa resulted in lower yield compared to its control, red clover planted at the same time as the cash crop resulted in lower yields, and perennial ryegrass had no effect on soybean yields. Finally, at Rosemount, MN, only alfalfa planted with the cash crop resulted in reduced yields compared to its control. All other cover crops and planting dates had no significant effects on soybean yields. At Waseca or Rosemount, MN, there were no effects of cover crop treatment on maize yields.
