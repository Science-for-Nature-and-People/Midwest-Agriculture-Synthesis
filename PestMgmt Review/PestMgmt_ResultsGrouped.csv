In 2004, plant stand at Arthur from untreated seed was significantly less than plant stand from azoxystrobin + metalaxyl-treated seed but not significantly different from plant stand from fludioxonil + mefenoxam- and B. pumilus GB34- treated seed. Plant stand at Casselton from fludioxonil + mefenoxam-treated seed was significantly less than plant stand from azoxystrobin + metalaxyl-treated seed but not significantly different from plant stand from untreated and B. pumilus GB34- treated seed. Plant stand at Fargo from untreated seed was significantly lower than plant stand from all of the other seed treatments. At this Fargo environment, plant stand from fludioxonil + mefenoxam- and azoxystrobin + metalaxyl- treated seed was significantly greater than plant stand from other treatments. Plant stand at Great Bend from untreated seed was significantly less than plant stand from fludioxonil + mefenoxam- and azoxystrobin + metalaxyl-treated seed but was not significantly different from plant stand from B. pumilus GB34-treated seed. Plant stand at Grandin from untreated seed was significantly lower than plant stand from all other treatments. Overall, plant stand was greater (P = 0.0001) in the 2003 environments compared with the 2004 environments according to a single-degree-of- freedom contrast.
