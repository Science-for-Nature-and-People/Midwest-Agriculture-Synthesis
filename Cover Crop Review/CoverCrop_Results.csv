This was the case for cumulative emissions during the period when the living cover crop was present (fall 2005spring 2006), and over the entire year. Lack of a cover crop effect could be partly due to disturbance caused by manure injection, which destroyed cover crop roots and plants in the injeion slit. Measurements performed in November 2005 showed that, on average, aboveground cover crop biomass was decreased by 48% in the disturbed areas where the liquid swine manure was injected (Singer et al., 2008). At the time the cover crop was killed (April 18, 2006) cover crop biomass increased approximately 10-fold from the previous fall (Singer et al., 2008), however N2O emissions were low in the non-cover crop treatments as well. Low N2O emissions at this time were likely due to the fact that mean daily air temperatures were typically <10 8C. Thus, when manure was first applied the cover crop plants and roots were physically destroyed in the injection zone and their effectiveness at taking up NO3 from this zone was reduced.

One exception was total winter annual weeds where the Italian ryegrass cover crop had higher weed density than did the wheat cover crop or the nontreated check. The high level of winter mortality of Italian ryegrass at this site may have inhibited the ability of this cover crop to suppress weed growth. In addition, the soil disturbance from the drill may have promoted additional weed density, resulting in higher weed density than the nontreated check had. SCN hatching, root penetration, and development occur
over a fairly wide range of temperatures, but the rate of SCN
growth and development is strongly temperature dependent.
The rate of SCN egg development increases linearly with
temperature between 15 and 30 C but ceases all together at
temperatures below 10 C (Alston and Schmitt 1988).
Previous studies have shown that henbit and purple deadnettle
can support SCN reproduction at levels comparable to SCNsusceptible
soybean in the greenhouse (Creech et al. 2007a;
Venkatesh et al. 2000). In the field, however, soil temperatures
are not optimal for SCN development at the time that
winter annual weeds are actively growing. Soil temperature
data collected in these plots over the course of the study
suggest that the period of overlap between high SCN activity
and winter annual weed growth is likely limited to a few weeks
in early autumn and late spring (data not shown).
Although the ability of SCN to reproduce on henbit and
purple deadnettle under field conditions in Indiana, Illinois,
and Ohio has also been confirmed (Creech et al. 2005,
2007b), the results of this 5-yr study suggest that SCN
reproduction on winter annual weeds appears to contribute
little, if any, to the overall SCN population levels in the field.
Nelson et al. (2006) reported an inconsistent response of SCN
to winter annual weed management in Missouri where the few
treatment differences that were observed in a single year were
not significant in another year.

Cover crop treatments radish/rye, radish/triticale, and radish/hairy vetch had significantly lower population than the other treatments.
