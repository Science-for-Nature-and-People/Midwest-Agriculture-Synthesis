Crop Yield. Soybean yield varied SCN hatching, root penetration, and development occur over a fairly wide range of temperatures, but the rate of SCN growth and development is strongly temperature dependent. The rate of SCN egg development increases linearly with temperature between 15 and 30 C but ceases all together at temperatures below 10 C (Alston and Schmitt 1988). Previous studies have shown that henbit and purple deadnettle can support SCN reproduction at levels comparable to SCN susceptible soybean in the greenhouse (Creech et al. 2007a; Venkatesh et al. 2000). In the field, however, soil temperatures are not optimal for SCN development at the time that winter annual weeds are actively growing. Soil temperature data collected in these plots over the course of the study suggest that the period of overlap between high SCN activity and winter annual weed growth is likely limited to a few weeks in early autumn and late spring (data not shown). Although the ability of SCN to reproduce on henbit and purple deadnettle under field conditions in Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio has also been confirmed (Creech et al. 2005,  2007b), the results of this 5-yr study suggest that SCN reproduction on winter annual weeds appears to contribute little, if any, to the overall SCN population levels in the field.

","""The results from this study show a decrease in the size of water-stable aggregates with complete residue removal at the rainfed site and general decrease in size of water-stable aggregates at the irrigated site after three years suggest that excessive residue removal could increase water erosion potential. The increase in wet aggregate stability with late-terminated cover crops and lack of change in wet aggegate stability between early-terminated cover crop and no cover crop at both sites strongly suggest that late-terminated cover crops can improve soil structural quality and reduce water erosion potential regardless of irrigation regime. The increased wet aggegate stability under late-terminated cover crop relative to early-terminated cover crop can be due to the greater biomass production under late-terminated cover crops.""","41 Plots received one of the following cover crop treatments: cereal rye @ 56-112 kg/ha, winter fallow (control). 41Cover crops were terminated with herbicide. 41 Plots were 104.04 sq m or 100 sq m.","41 Ruis, S.J., Blanco-Canqui, H., Jasa, P.J., Ferguson, R.B., & Slater, G.
