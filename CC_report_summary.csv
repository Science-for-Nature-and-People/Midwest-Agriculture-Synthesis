growth and development is strongly temperature dependent.
The rate of SCN egg development increases linearly with
temperature between 15 and 30 C but ceases all together at
temperatures below 10 C (Alston and Schmitt 1988).
Previous studies have shown that henbit and purple deadnettle
can support SCN reproduction at levels comparable to SCNsusceptible
soybean in the greenhouse (Creech et al. 2007a;
Venkatesh et al. 2000). In the field, however, soil temperatures
are not optimal for SCN development at the time that
winter annual weeds are actively growing. Soil temperature
data collected in these plots over the course of the study
suggest that the period of overlap between high SCN activity
and winter annual weed growth is likely limited to a few weeks
in early autumn and late spring (data not shown).
Although the ability of SCN to reproduce on henbit and
purple deadnettle under field conditions in Indiana, Illinois,
and Ohio has also been confirmed (Creech et al. 2005,
2007b), the results of this 5-yr study suggest that SCN
reproduction on winter annual weeds appears to contribute
little, if any, to the overall SCN population levels in the field.

treatment differences that were observed in a single year were

The rate of SCN egg development increases linearly with temperature between 15 and 30 C but ceases all together at temperatures below 10 C (Alston and Schmitt 1988). Previous studies have shown that henbit and purple deadnettle can support SCN reproduction at levels comparable to SCN susceptible soybean in the greenhouse (Creech et al. 2007a; Venkatesh et al. 2000). In the field, however, soil temperatures are not optimal for SCN development at the time that winter annual weeds are actively growing. Soil temperature data collected in these plots over the course of the study suggest that the period of overlap between high SCN activity and winter annual weed growth is likely limited to a few weeks in early autumn and late spring (data not shown). Although the ability of SCN to reproduce on henbit and purple deadnettle under field conditions in Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio has also been confirmed (Creech et al. 2005,  2007b), the results of this 5-yr study suggest that SCN reproduction on winter annual weeds appears to contribute little, if any, to the overall SCN population levels in the field.

One exception was total winter annual weeds where the Italian ryegrass cover crop had higher weed density than did the wheat cover crop or the nontreated check. The high level of winter mortality of Italian ryegrass at this site may have inhibited the ability of this cover crop to suppress weed growth. In addition, the soil disturbance from the drill may have promoted additional weed density, resulting in higher weed density than the nontreated check had.

Soybean yields (three-year average) were 2,462, 2,011, 1,462, and 677 kg/ha (37, 30, 22, and 10 bushels/acre) for the control, chickweed, brome, and bluegrass treatments, respectively. Soybean yields averaged 41% and 73% less in brome and bluegrass plots (P< 0.05) than in control plots, presumably because of the early- to mid-season competition ofr soil water. Soybean yield in the chickweed treatment was 18% less than in the control treatment, but the difference was not significant (P>0.10).","58 Plots received one of the following cover crop treatments: winter fallow (control), Canada bluegrass (Poa compressa L.), chickweed (Stelleria media L.), downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.).  58 Plots were 10.24 sq m.","58 Zhu, J.C., Gantzer, C.J., Anderson, S.H., Beuselinck, P.R., & Alberts, E.E.
