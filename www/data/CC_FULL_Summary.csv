In the first two years (2006 & 2007), significant effects of cover crops resulted in reductions in yields. The cover crops that consistantly reduced yields during these two years were Aroostook (winter rye), Dacold (winter rye), Boreal (winter triticale) and NE-422t (winter triticale). In the second two years of the experiment (2008 & 2009), there were no significant effects of cover crops on maize yields.

Previous studies have shown that henbit and purple deadnettle
can support SCN reproduction at levels comparable to SCNsusceptible
soybean in the greenhouse (Creech et al. 2007a;
Venkatesh et al. 2000). In the field, however, soil temperatures
are not optimal for SCN development at the time that
winter annual weeds are actively growing. Soil temperature

First spring nitrate and ammonium pools were significantly smaller in the cover crop treatment, which reduced the potentail for spring losses following snowmelt and soil warming. In a recent cover cropping study, McSwiney and others (2010) also found decreased nitrate concentrations with a cereal rye cover crop, and reduced potential for nitrate leaching. Further, we found a negative relationship between rye biomass and the soil nitrate pool illustrating the value of planting cover crop early to establish a good stand. These findings support other literature on the potential for winter cover crops to improve nitrogen-use effiency (Tonitto et al., 2006), but their ability to capture nitrogen in the fall is limited in corn-soybean rotations given how late they are planted and the complex interactions between management practices and weather.",1036,"Water Quality","Nutrient Runoff","Nitrate",-22.979797979798,-9.1,"Single species","Non-legume",NA
